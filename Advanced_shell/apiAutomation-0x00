# Task 0: API Request Automation
# Objective: Fetch Pikachu data and save it to data.json
# If the request fails, log the error to errors.txt

URL="https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu"
OUTPUT_FILE="data.json"
ERROR_FILE="errors.txt"

# Make the API request silently, save output to file
curl -s "$URL" -o "$OUTPUT_FILE"

# Check curl exit code
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    # Log error with timestamp
    echo "$(date): Failed to fetch data from $URL" >> "$ERROR_FILE"
    exit 1
fi

# Optional: verify file is not empty (extra safety)
if [ ! -s "$OUTPUT_FILE" ]; then
    echo "$(date): Empty response received from $URL" >> "$ERROR_FILE"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Successfully fetched Pikachu data and saved to $OUTPUT_FILE"


After running the script:
bash task0.sh

You can check the output with:
